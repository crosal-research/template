<ul>
<li>We met politicians of the highest caliber from the government's side of the aisle yesterday in Brasilia.</li>
<li>Overall, they agreed the social security reform ought to be tackled as soon as possible, though support in the Lower House is running short at the moment.</li>
<li>There were some different views on how much the second charge against President Temer may be an impediment for that.</li>
<li>As for the fiscal agenda given by provisional measures and the likes, however, views were more reassuring.</li>
<li>As expected, 2018 election is ever more present on their radar screen, and, accordingly, the economic recovery is increasingly present on the political logic.</li>
