- We met politicians of the highest caliber from
  the government's side of the aisle yesterday in Brasilia.
- Overall, they agreed the social security reform ought to
  be tackled as soon as possible, though support in the Lower House is
  running short at the moment.
- There were some different views on how much the second charge
  against President Temer may be an impediment for that.
- As for the fiscal agenda given by provisional measures and the
  likes, however, views were more reassuring.
- As expected, 2018 election is ever more present on their radar
  screen, and, accordingly, the economic recovery is increasingly
  present on the political logic.
