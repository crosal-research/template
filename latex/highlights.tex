\begin{compactitem}
\item We held a very lively and rich conversation with Mr. Bolsonaro of
about 2 hours and half yesterday. The main takeaways were:
\begin{compactitem}
\item His presidential candidacy is unlikely to be as easily destructed
as many may think. He is actually laying out a well thought over
strategy to keep his poll ratings, despite his lacking of
political infrastructure.
\item His economic agenda is still taking shape, but one can spot
many traits of a center-right agenda.
\item He still misses a convincing strategy to coalesce with political
establishment in order to deliver, should he be chosen the next
President.
\end{compactitem}
\item Overall, he looks more prepared to the campaign than depicted by
many press' accounts, thus supporting the idea that his candidacy is not
necessarily a passing fad.
\end{compactitem}
