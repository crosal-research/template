\begin{document}

\begin{compactitem}
\item We met politicians of the highest caliber from
the government's side of the aisle yesterday in Brasilia.
\item Overall, they agreed the social security reform ought to
be tackled as soon as possible, though support in the Lower House is
running short at the moment.
\item There were some different views on how much the second charge
against President Temer may be an impediment for that.
\item As for the fiscal agenda given by provisional measures and the
likes, however, views were more reassuring.
\item As expected, 2018 election is ever more present on their radar
screen, and, accordingly, the economic recovery is increasingly
present on the political logic.
